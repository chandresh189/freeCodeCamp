## Bayes Theorem

- Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. 
- It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
- The theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions or theories given new or additional evidence. 
- In finance, Bayes' theorem can be used to rate the risk of lending money to potential borrowers.
Bayesâ€™ Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

- The formula is:

Which tells us:	 	how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B), 
When we know:	 	how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A)      
 	 	and how likely A is on its own, written P(A)                             
 	 	and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)
